# Customer-Billing-System
Customer Billing System Project is a simple console application designed to demonstrate the practical use of C programming language and its features as wells as to generate an application which can be used in any departmental store, shops, cafes etc. for billing to the customer.

You can use this application to keep the records such as name, address, mobile number, paid amount, due amount, payment date etc. of your regular costumer. Moreover, if you have a new customer, you can add and edit the account at any time.

The source code of Customer Billing System Project in C has been written in C programming language without of the use of any graphics. The code is complete, totally error free and not that long – just. It is to be compiled in Code::Blocks  using GCC compiler.

### User Defined Functions Used:

Although graphics has not been used in this project, the application of user defined functions and structures have been effectively used here. The major user defined functions used in this C project are:
1. `void input()`                                                                                                                  
2. `void writefile()`                                                                                                                  
3. `void search()`                                                                                                                     
4. `void output()`

The function `void input()` is used to add the new customer account i.e. with the help of this functions the parameters such as name, address, phone number, amount paid etc. are asked and entered. Another function `void writefile()` has been utilized to create a file on hard disk of computer for storing the information and data of a customer.

The function `void search()` has been used to look for previously stored accounts either by name or by number of the customer. The fourth and the last user defined function used in this Customer Billing System Project in C is `void output()` which has been defined to show the result as console output.

In Customer Billing System, structure has very beautifully used to group the data type in single unit. The date variables (`day`, `month` and `year`) have been grouped in the structures named date where as other variables such as name, number, street, paid amount etc. are grouped under another structure named account.

Customer Billing System application is so simple to use. In order to use the application, click at the exe file and then, you will have three options to:

1. `To add account`
2. `To search account`
3. `To exit`

As per your need, enter 1, 2,or 3 and follow the instructions provided by the application itself.

### Features:

It can hold any number of accounts and account can be added to the program at any time.
The programming of simple calculations such as calculation of due amount, balance etc. have been embed in the code of project.
The Customer Billing System project in C gives you the facility of searching the account by two ways, either by name of the customer or by the number of customer.
The due amount to be paid is shown as negative balance.
If you have nothing to do with the program, you can directly exit from the main menu.

The project can be used in many aspects, firstly the application file generated can be used. Secondly the source code of Customer Billing System project in C can be used to learn C programming and its different features such as use of user defined functions, structures etc. Submitting this C project as your college/school C project without any modifications is completely discouraged.
